# Monitoring with PowerShell
See https://www.cyberdrain.com/category/series-powershell-monitoring/ for more information.

All scripts uploaded to this repo are related to the blogs above and are often used in conjunection with a RMM system, Azure Functions, etc. These scripts are not designed to run on their own and often do not output anything to the console directly.

I've decided to only upload the scripts from my blog starting 01-2020 as otherwise I'd have to copy and paste more than 300 scripts. :)
